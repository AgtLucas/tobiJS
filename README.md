# tobiJS
2D Game framework for HTML5 ~ good as a good dog.
Test the alpha build of tobiJS in a game example here.

I'm a OO programmer and now I'm learning Javascript. 
A lot of stuff of this repository was written learning in another APIs like Phaser, melonJS, PIXI and others.
For a while the code is mess.
